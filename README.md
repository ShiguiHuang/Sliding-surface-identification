# Sliding-surface-identification
> Sliding surface identification program

The program is written by python and its OpenCV,alpha shape library, which can identify the sliding surface recognition based on the total displacement contour map.

After downloading this project, you can directly run *Sliding_identification_program.ipynb* file after configuring the python environment as required.
